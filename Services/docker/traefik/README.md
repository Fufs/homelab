# Traefik

## TODO
- Update to new version
- Add all services here
- Change docker compose and config to have better dir structure (some work has started on this)
- Figure out how to add .env in configs (for secrets, and common vars like domain)
- Strip out details about running setup
- Traefik config w/ all options and defaults commented out
